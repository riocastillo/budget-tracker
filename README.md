## Goal
Create a fullstack team Budget App with User Login. 

## How it's made
Made using CSS, Javascript, Node.js, JSON, Express, EJS, MongoDB, and User Authentification using passport.

## Lessons learned
Want to come back to this project and clean up the js - mainly because I don't like that the variables rely heavily on parenNode or childNodes dynmics. It makes the code more breakable and I ran into problems with keeping the parent/child dynamics consistent when I styled this project. I'd like to class up the code, and come back to add a column that subtracts the user's budget from the goal's budget and displays how much money is left to spend or save up, depending on how the user is utilizing this app.
