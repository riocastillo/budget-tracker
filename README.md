## Goal
Create a fullstack team Budget App with User Login.

## How it's made
Made using CSS, Javascript, Node.js, JSON, Express, EJS, MongoDB, and User Authentification using passport.

## Lessons learned
Would like to come back and clean up the js so its variables aren't dependent on parent nodes / child nodes so much. They aren't sustainable, and the code broke a lot in the process of styling, so I kinda hated using them. Plan to come back to this, class everything up, and I'd like to add a column that subtracts the current balance to the budget balance and outputs the difference so people know how much money they have left to spend or save up, depending on how they're using this app.
